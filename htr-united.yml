  The OCR-D Ground Truth text and structure corpus was created between
  2015-2017. In the years since 2017, this corpus has been further curated and
  supplemented with metadata where appropriate. The corpus includes page XML
  files within annotations of the text and structure include. The data is based
  on transcription data stored in the German Text Archive (DTA)
  (https://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/).
